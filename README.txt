# Deep Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition



This is a code repository for the CSC8635 Machine Learning Project



## Folders

  

	1. Exploaratory_Data_Analysis - Contains the code and the report for the exploratory data analysis document.

	2. Machine_Learning_Models - Contains the .ipynb notebooks for the machine learning models used in the report.

        3. Pre-Processing_Notebooks - Contains the .ipynb notebooks for the data pre-processing stage of the report.
 
        4. PythonNotebooks - Contains duplicate .ipynb notebooks that have been used in the report and other draft reports.

        5. Reports - Contains a copy of the project report and a PDF of the structured abstract and key images.



### Exploratory Data Analysis



```

The code in this section can be re-run to repeat the analyis. There is a PDF document provided which contains my EDA.


```



### Machine Learning Models
 


```

This folder contains the .ipynb code used in the report for the deep learning part. The analysis can be re-run by uploading the notebooks to a Google Colab environment or alternatively on a local machine. The data will have to be generated using the notebooks in the Pre-Processing_Notebooks folder.



```


### Pre-Processing Notebooks



``` 

This folder contains the .ipynb code used in the report for the data pre-processing part. The analysis can be re-run on a local computer provided that the data for the challenge is downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge). The notebooks will have to be ran so that the data can be generated for the Machine Learning Models notebooks.


```


### PythonNotebooks



```
 
Contains code that I was working with before readying this repository for submission. I've included these files if you wish to have a look at some of the draft work I was doing, however, if possible, I would not want these files considered for marking as I do not feel they will best represent my work and everything I feel is essential is included in the other files.



```


### Reports



```

Contains a PDF copy of the final report for the CSC8635 module and a PDF containing the structured abstract and the 2 key images from the project.
